# DeepLearning_CategorizePhotoOrientation
Source: Problem picked from Kaggle

The cameraman has a service that scans photographs and slides to store them digitally. He uses a machine that quickly scans many photos. But depending on the orientation of the original photo, many images are digitized sideways.  He currently spends a lot of time looking find which photos need to be rotated sideways, so he can fix them.

It would save him a lot of time if this process could be automated. To automate we will have to build a model that distinguishes which photos are sideways and which are upright.

Dataset used is small dataset of dog pictures, half of which are rotated sideways.
